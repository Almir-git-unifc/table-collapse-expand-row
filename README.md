# Intro <a name = "Intro"></a>

This project was found in codesandbox.io with the title 'react table expand-collapse row' .

However, during my development, one of the differences in relation to the original project was that while one line is shown, all other lines are hidden; and another difference was displaying variable information that is stored in the table itself.

<!-- 
Example: Layout de site responsivo, simples, criado com cÃ³digo html, css e javascript; usando regra de mÃ­dia, barra de rolagem, Ã­cone de sanduÃ­che e menu deslizante 
 -->



# Feature <a name = "Feature"></a>
- react component
- Collapse 


&nbsp;
# Technologies <a name = "Technologies"></a>

The original project was written in react typescript; and I rewrote it in Vite using JavaScript.

One of the differences from the original project was modifying the Collapse code so that when a line was displayed, all other lines were hidden, and only one line was displayed at a time, working like a personalized accordion.

Another change was to modify the 'collapse' line that showed unchanged information and now displays variable information, which is obtained in a column of the table.

And it also assigns a different color to the line displayed in the collapse than the other lines.
